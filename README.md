# SLAC
Student Learning Assistant for Classrooms

SLAC is a deep learning-based video processing project (proof of concept) that has an android app in its front end and python-based flask backend. This was designed to help the faculty identify the topics during which the students were inattentive in the classroom. This is done by identifying the topics during which the students are sleeping or are not facing the lecturer from the classroom video. This program also identifies the students based on facial recognition and gives them attendance if present in the classroom.

Please see the report.pdf for a detail description of the project. Pages 28-35 contain the screenshots of the application.
